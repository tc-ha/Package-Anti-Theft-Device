## About The Project



As the demand for non-face-to-face delivery, which does not receive parcels directly in front of the house, has increased, the risk of lost delivery has risen.

As a result, many services have been created to monitor the front door by installing CCTVs linked to smartphones.

However, even if it is not a stolen situation, it can be reported to the user if all movements are detected, which can be inefficient and infringe on the privacy of neighbors by requiring unnecessary monitoring from the user.

Therefore, this project proposes a service that determines the act of taking a package, selectively shoots the situation, and reports it to the user.
